### Problem Title: Add Strings

#### Problem Description:

Given two non-negative integers, `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the sum of `num1` and `num2` as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers. Also, you must not directly convert the inputs to integers.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: num1 = "23", num2 = "74"
Output: "97"
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"
```
#### Example 3:
```
Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
Output: "0"
```
